# Artsy Employee Meetings

As a remote Artsy employee, I join a lot of Zoom meetings. Joining a meeting is a two-click process at best, and it takes about 10 seconds at the worst of times. This extension makes it a one-click no-hassle, never-even-need-to-think-about-it experience.

It sends you a desktop notification exactly when the meeting is scheduled to start, and if you click the notification it automatically opens Zoom.

It also shows you a list of upcoming or in-progress meetings, and you can disable the desktop notifications if that's not your thing.

## Development

Run

    $ yarn && yarn start

Then enable 'developer mode' in [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) and load this extension as an 'unpacked' extension from `dist/chrome`

    $ gulp

| Option         | Description                                                                                                                      |

| `--verbose`    | Log additional data to the console.                                                                                              |
| `--vendor`     | Compile the extension for different vendors (chrome, firefox, opera, edge) Default: chrome                                       |
| `--sourcemaps` | Force the creation of sourcemaps. Default: !production                                                                           |

### pack

Zips your `dist` directory and saves it in the `packages` directory.

    $ gulp pack --vendor=firefox

### Version

Increments version number of `manifest.json` and `package.json`,
commits the change to git and adds a git tag.

    $ gulp patch      // => 0.0.X

or

    $ gulp feature    // => 0.X.0

or

    $ gulp release    // => X.0.0

## Globals

The build tool also defines a variable named `process.env.NODE_ENV` in your scripts. It will be set to `development` unless you use the `--production` option.

**Example:** `./app/background.ts`

```typescript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
  console.log("We are in development mode!")
}
```
